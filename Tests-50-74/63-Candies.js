// Test description:
// n children have got m pieces of candy. They 
// want to eat as much candy as they can, but each 
// child must eat exactly the same amount of candy 
// as any other child. Determine how many pieces 
// of candy will be eaten by all the children 
// together. Individual pieces of candy cannot 
// be split.
// Example
// For n = 3 and m = 10, the output should be
// solution(n, m) = 9.
// Each child will eat 3 pieces. So the answer is 9.

// Parameters
const p1 = 3
const p2 = 10

// My Solution
function solution(n, m) {
    return 1;
}

// Best solution:
function bestSolution(n, m) {
    return 1;
}

// console log
console.log("My Solution: ", solution(p1, p2))
console.log("Best Solution: ", bestSolution(p1, p2))
